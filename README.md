## ABOUT THIS PROJECT:

This project aims to provide a reasonable amount of scripts and code for beginners who — just as I am — are starting to learn how to code from the stratch. It is a way of docummenting my learning process and, at the same time, helping others in the meanwhile.

As I see the importance of having readable and useful project samples for those who are kickstarting their path into programming, I've decided to put it together for anyone who is interested in reading and learning with simple code samples.

The programming languages that we are going to focus here may be **Python**, **Ruby**, **Shell Script**, and **Javascript**. As I have recently started to work with InfoSec, several scripts will be focused on reproducing well-known tools used in pentesting, vulnerability assessment, and so forth.

The codes available here are going to be extensively commented to make it easier to read and understand. Codes which I am not the author but have been added to this project by a request will be credited accordingly.

Please note that, as a beginner, mistakes may be made. This is not a repository made by professionals for beginners, but by beginners for beginners.

## SCRIPTS:

**Bulldozer:** it is a tool used to brute-force directories in websites, similar to the well-known tool 'dirb' and 'dirsearch' - the latter also built in Python.

**Methods:** work in progress!

Enjoy!
