BULLDOZER 1.0
Made in Tokyo

The features included in this tool can be found in well-known and widely-used tools like dirb, gobuster, dirsearch, and so forth. If you want to understand a more robust approach to it, please check the aforementioned tools' source-code.

This tool was made to brute-force directories in websites and applications in a very simple way:

It sends several requests containing well-known/common directory names within a wordlist and it returns the status code to the user, informing which is the result of the request that was just sent.

1 - The first argument must contain the URL with "http://" or "https://" included and no "/" at the end

2 - The second argument must contain a wordlist as "/path/file". If not declared, Bulldozer will use a default wordlist.

Examples:

python3 bulldozer.py https://example.com example.txt - Bulldozer will use the wordlist set by the user

python3 bulldozer.py https://example.com - Bulldozer will use its default wordlist
